        has not completed. Setup should not take more than a few minutes.
        Reattempt setup by turning the device off and back on. The most common
        cause of setup not completing is bad WiFi credentials.

        <strong>Note for Rock Pi:</strong> balena's instructions specify that
        the device is powered off when the LED is no longer on. The blue LED
        indicates the device is on; the green LED indicates the device is merely
        plugged in, and so will not turn off.

**Note for _SamizdApp Box_ devices:** If your device is a _SamizdApp Box_
received from us, then congratulations, your device is already set up! You can
skip this step and proceed to [Setup Your Client](setup-client.md). For all
other devices, this step is required.

To setup your device, you'll need to connect it to balenaCloud. Balena is used
for managing deployments of the SamizdApp software to your device.

The recommended way to connect to balena is to join the official SamizdApp
fleet. However, if you wish to customize the software on your device or
contribute to the development of SamizdApp, you'll need to configure
self-managed deployments.

Ensure your device is powered off before beginning.

## Join the Fleet (Recommended)

The recommended way to setup your device is to join the official SamizdApp
fleet.

1. Open up the fleet at:
   https://hub.balena.io/organizations/gh_rynomad/fleets/rock.
2. Click on "Get started" to add your device to the fleet.
3. Follow the instructions on the right of the "Add new device" screen
   (after inserting the SD card, power on the device):

   <AddNewDevice Success={() => <> </>} />

4. Wait for 10 minutes for the device to finish updating, then proceed
   to <a href="setup-client">setup your client</a>.

## Self-Managed Deployments (For Developers)

If you wish to customize the software on your device or contribute to the
development of SamizdApp, you'll need to manage deployments to your device
yourself.

### Add Device to Fleet

To setup and configure your device using balena, you'll need to create a free
balenaCloud account, create a fleet, and add your device to that fleet.
This section assumes your device is a ROCK Pi 4B; however, any of the
[devices that balena supports](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/hardware/devices/)
should work.

1. Sign up for an account at https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/.
2. From the "Fleets" screen, click "Create fleet".
3. Follow the docs at
   https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/getting-started/raspberrypi3/nodejs/#create-a-fleet
   to finish creating your fleet, adding your device, and provisioning your
   device.
4. Follow the remainder of the "Add new device" Instructions section
   (after inserting the SD card, power on the device):

   <AddNewDevice />

5. Once the device shows up in your fleet dashboard with the status "Online",
   your device should be ready to go.
6. Remember to remove the SD Card from your device once it is set up.

### Clone the Repository

Use Git to clone the Herakles repo into your dev environment:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:samizdapp/herakles.git --recurse-submodules
```

The remainder of the docs will assume that you are in the base directory of
the Herakles repo unless otherwise specified:

```bash
cd herakles/
```

### Configure Your Dev Environment

In order to easily deploy code from your dev environment to your device, you'll
need to install the balena CLI.

1. Continue following the same docs as before to install balena CLI:
   https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/getting-started/raspberrypi3/nodejs/#install-the-balena-cli

### Push a Release

After the CLI is installed, and you have logged in, you can push a release of
SamizdApp to your device.

1. Build the entire project and push it to your device via balenaCloud (expect
   this to take awhile before completing):
   ```
   balena push ${org}/${fleet} -m
   ```
   where `${org}` is the name of your organization, typically your username,
   and `${fleet}` is the name you gave to you fleet. (The full slug of your
   fleet can easily be copied from the fleet Summary page.)
2. Once the push has successfully completed, balena will propagate it to all
   the devices in your fleet. You can monitor this in the dashboard page for
   your device in balenaCloud. Once the release for all services has been
   updated, the deployment is complete. You can monitor the logs for any
   runtime errors.
