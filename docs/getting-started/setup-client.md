# Setup Your Client

Once you're device is up and running, you'll want to setup the client that
you'll use to access the SamizdApp network. The following options are for the
officially supported browsers/devices; however, other browsers/devices will
likely work as well.

## Chrome on Desktop

1. In Google Chrome, navigate to http://setup.local/pwa.
2. If you see a message saying "the origin is trusted!", then click on the
   install button in the address bar:

   ![Install button located in the right side of the address bar](/img/install-button.png)

   (If you don't see the trusted message or the install button, then something
   has gone wrong.)

3. In the popup, select "Install"

You should be redirected to Pleroma.

## Chrome on Android

1. Install the
   [Android App](https://expo.dev/accounts/samizdapp/projects/tcproxy/builds/27bdc55b-5de1-4fc4-9cd6-6bb4976c9fdb).
2. After installation, open the app.

## Safari on iOS
