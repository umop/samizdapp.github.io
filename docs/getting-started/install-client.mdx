# Install the Client

Once you're box is up and running, you'll want to set up the client device that
you'll use to access the SamizdApp network. The following options are for the
officially supported browsers/devices; however, other browsers/devices will
likely work as well.

## Chrome/Brave on Desktop

1. Navigate to `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure` in
   Google Chrome, or `brave://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`
   in Brave.

2. Set the "Insecure origins treated as secure" flag to "Enabled", and add
   `http://samizdapp.local` to the flag's textbox field.

3. At the bottom of the screen, click Relaunch.

4. Navigate to http://samizdapp.local/smz/pwa. If this URL does not load (you get
   a browser error), it is likely because the box is still updating. Wait 5
   more minutes and try again.

5. If you see a message saying "Install the PWA to continue.", then click on the
   install button in the address bar:

   ![Install button located in the right side of the address bar](/img/install-button.png)

   (If you don't see the install message or the install button, then something
   has gone wrong.)

6. In the popup, select "Install"

You should be redirected to Pleroma.

## Chrome/Brave on Android

<InfoBox>
  For Android versions <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>less than 12</span>,
  these additional steps must be completed{" "}
  <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>before</span> continuing (you'll lose
  internet access on your device, so it's recommended to have these docs open
  on your laptop):

  <ol>
   <li>Ensure your box is connected via <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>ethernet</span> (required).</li>
   <li>Restart your box by powering it off and on again.</li>
   <li>Connect your device to your box's WiFi network:
      <ol>
         <li>In your device's list of available WiFi networks, select the network named "SamizdApp".</li>
         <li>Enter the security key: <code>samizdapp</code>.</li>
      </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>
</InfoBox>

Follow these steps to install the client on your Android device:

1. Follow steps 1-4 of the [Chrome/Brave on Desktop](#chromebrave-on-desktop)
   instructions.
2. If you see a message saying "Install the PWA to continue.", then look for
   the PWA installation button. It may popup at the bottom of your screen the
   same time as the message. You should definitely be able to find it inside
   your browser's hamburger menu.

## Safari on iOS
