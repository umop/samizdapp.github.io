# Set Up Your Box

<InfoBox>
  These instructions assume that SamizdApp is already installed on your box. A{" "}
  <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>SamizdApp Box</span> received from us
  will have SamizdApp properly installed on it. However, if you wish to use your
  own device, you'll need to complete the setup in{" "}
  <a href="../advanced-setup/byob" target="_blank">
    BYOB (Bring Your Own Box)
  </a>{" "}
  first.
</InfoBox>

## Unpack Your Box

Remove your box from its packaging and **select a place** in your room to set
it up. You should select a place where the box won't be at risk of damage;
avoid exposing your box to extreme temperatures or direct sunlight.

Your box needs internet connectivity, so also make sure that it has access to
**ethernet** from where you place it.

<InfoBox>
  Officially, ethernet connectivity is a requirement to run the box; however,
  you can attempt to connect the box{" "}
  <a href="../advanced-setup/connect-wifi" target="_blank">
    via Wi-Fi
  </a>{" "}
  instead.
</InfoBox>

## Power On Your Box

Plug the **power chord** into your box and the other end into a power source;
you should see the power light of your box turn on. Once plugged in, the status
light should turn on, and your box should automatically boot. After several
seconds (up to a minute), the status light should begin blinking regularly to
indicate the box has successfully booted.

Wait **5-10 minutes** for your box to download and install updates.
