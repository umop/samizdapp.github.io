# Setup Your Box

**Note:** These instructions assume that SamizdApp is already installed on your box. A
_SamizdApp Box_ received from us will have SamizdApp properly installed on it.
However, if you wish to use your own device, you'll need to complete the setup in
[BYOB (Bring Your Own Box)](../advanced-setup/byob) first.

## Unpack Your Box

Remove your box from its packaging and select a place in your room to set it
up. You should select a place that has good connectivity to your local network
and where the box won't be at risk of damage. Avoid exposing your box to
extreme temperatures or direct sunlight.

## Power On Your Box

Plug the power chord into your box and the other end into a power source; you
should see the power light of your box turn on. Once plugged in, the status
light should turn on, and your box should automatically boot. After several
seconds (up to a minute), the status light should begin blinking regularly to
indicate the box has successfully booted.

Wait 5 - 10 minutes for your box to download and install updates.
