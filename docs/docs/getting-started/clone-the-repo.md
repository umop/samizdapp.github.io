# Clone the Repository

Use Git to clone the Herakles repo into your dev environment:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:samizdapp/herakles.git --recurse-submodules
```

The remainder of the docs will assume that you are in the base directory of
the Herakles repo unless otherwise specified:

```bash
cd herakles/
```
